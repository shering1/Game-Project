Notes:

- The Game class should be kept as simple as possible
- You should create classes when you can make a sentence out of why you need that specific thing
    - Ex: I need a player in order to play the game (noun/verb)
- Member functions should be doing only ONE thing
    - Whatever you name the function, that's the action the function should be completing
- When you initialize something, it means that space in memory has been allocated for it
    - Example(of wrong):
        - var selectedCards: HashMap<String, String>
            - this just says the map exists, it is NOT initialized
            - if you tried to add values to this map, it would break
    - Example(of right):
        - var selectedCards = HashMap<String, String>()
        - this is initialized as an empty hash map and space in memory has been allocated for it
- It's better practice to send data into the constructor of a class instead of setting it later
